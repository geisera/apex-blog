## Pass Data From a Child FlexCard to a Parent FlexCard

### Overview

After embedding a child FlexCard inside another FlexCard, you can pass data from the child to its parent as input parameters from a **Custom Event** action on the child.
Use an event listener to execute a **Set Values** action to update fields on the parent.

Create a child FlexCard or select one from the FlexCards home tab.

### Add a custom event to the child FlexCard:

- Drag an **Action** element onto the canvas.
- Set the **Action Type** to **_Event_**
- Set the **Event Type** to **_Custom_**
- Enter a name in the **Event Name** field.
- In the **Input Parameters** section, click **+ Add New**
- Under **Input Parameters** enter a name for the data you want to call in the **Key** input field.
- Under **Input Parameters** enter a value to pass. Or, enter a merge field from the child's data source.
- Activate the child FlexCard.

Create the parent FlexCard or open one from the FlexCards home tab.

### Create an Event Listener on the Parent FlexCard

- Drag a FlexCard element from the **Build** panel onto the canvas.
- Click into the FlexCard **Name** field and select the child FlexCard you created previously.
- In the Setup panel, click **+ Add New** in the **Event Listener** section.
- Under **Event Type** select **Custom Event**.
- In the **Event Name** input field, enter the name of the event you created in the child FlexCard.
- In the Actions section, under **Action Type** select **Card**
- In the Actions section under **Type** select **Set Values**.
- In the new **Set Values** section, click **+ Add New**.
- In the **Key** input field, select the data field to update.
- In the **Value** input field, use the `{action.param}` syntax to pass the data you emitted in your child FlexCard action.

To preview and test, click Preview. Click the action in the child FlexCard to update a data field in the parent.
