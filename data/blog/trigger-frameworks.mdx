## 🧠 **Salesforce Trigger Framework Study Guide**

### 📌 **1. Understanding Apex Triggers**

* **Purpose:** Automate actions in response to DML events (Insert, Update, Delete, Undelete).
* **Timing:** Can run `before` or `after` DML.
* **Scope:** Can be created on most standard and all custom objects.
* **Order of Execution:** Triggers fire at specific steps in Salesforce’s order of operations (especially steps 5 and 19).
* **Best Practice:** **One Trigger per Object** to:

  * Control execution order.
  * Simplify debugging.
  * Enable easier toggling (disable/enable).

### 📌 **2. Trigger Handler Pattern**

* **Problem with Large Triggers:**

  * Duplicate logic across events.
  * Difficult testing and debugging.
  * Spaghetti code in multi-event triggers.
* **Solution: Trigger Handler Class**

  * Move logic from trigger to a dedicated Apex class.
  * Each event (e.g., `beforeInsert`) has its own method.
  * Cleaner triggers, reusable logic, easier testing.

#### 🧪 **Example:**

```apex
trigger LeadTrigger on Lead (before insert, after insert) {
    if (Trigger.isBefore && Trigger.isInsert) {
        new LeadTriggerHandler().handleBeforeInsert(Trigger.new);
    }
}
```

### 📌 **3. Trigger Frameworks Overview**

Frameworks abstract and simplify trigger logic with reusable base classes, standardized event routing, and control over recursion and trigger disabling.

### ⚙️ **4. Framework 1: Virtual Class-Based**

#### ✅ Benefits:

* Use a **base virtual class** with overridable event methods.
* Centralized routing via `.run()` method.
* Only override needed methods.
* Clean, consistent triggers (`1 line`).

#### 🧱 Structure:

* `Trigger` → `LeadTriggerHandler` (extends base class) → `TriggerHandler.run()` → `beforeInsert()`

#### ✨ Features:

* Routing based on trigger context (set in constructor).
* Optional: recursion check, trigger bypass.

#### 🔁 Example:

```apex
trigger LeadTrigger on Lead (before insert, after insert) {
    new LeadTriggerHandler().run();
}
```

### ⚙️ **5. Framework 2: Interface-Based**

#### ✅ Benefits:

* Enforces structure with an `ITriggerHandler` interface.
* `Dispatcher` class handles routing.
* Supports disabling triggers via UI (custom settings) or code (static flags).

#### 🧱 Structure:

* `Trigger` → `Dispatcher.run(new ContactTriggerHandler())` → Handler class

#### ✨ Features:

* All context methods (`beforeInsert`, `afterUpdate`, etc.) are required in handler class (can be blank).
* Strong consistency across org.

#### 🔁 Example:

```apex
trigger ContactTrigger on Contact (before insert, after insert) {
    TriggerDispatcher.run(new ContactTriggerHandler());
}
```

### ⚙️ **6. Framework 3: Full Object-Oriented (OO) Architecture**

#### ✅ Benefits:

* Maximum flexibility and separation of concerns.
* Supports **different logic for main trigger vs recursive/in-progress triggers**.
* Modular: one class per event/context.

#### 🧱 Structure:

* `Trigger` → `TriggerFactory` → `AccountTriggerDispatcher` → Routing → `AccountBeforeInsertHandler`

#### 🧩 Classes:

* `TriggerFactory`: Finds dispatcher based on object type.
* `Dispatcher Interface` + `Base Dispatcher`: Handles routing, recursion check.
* `Handler Interface` + `Base Handler`: Implements `mainEntry()` and `inProgressEntry()`.
* **One handler class per event** (e.g., `AccountBeforeInsertHandler`).

#### ✨ Features:

* Granular control per event.
* Easy to test in isolation.
* Naming conventions matter (`AccountBeforeInsertHandler` expected).

### 🔄 **7. Comparison Summary**

| Feature           | Virtual Class      | Interface-Based    | OO Architecture                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Complexity        | Low                | Medium             | High                            |
| Setup Effort      | Low                | Medium             | High                            |
| Required Methods  | Only override used | Must implement all | Main/in-progress per event      |
| Routing           | Built-in           | Dispatcher         | Factory + Dispatcher            |
| Disable Support   | Optional           | Yes (UI/code)      | Yes (UI/code)                   |
| Recursion Control | Optional           | Yes                | Yes                             |
| Reusability       | Good               | Good               | Excellent                       |
| Ideal Use         | Simple-medium orgs | Medium orgs        | Complex orgs with many triggers |


### 🧩 **8. Additional Best Practices**

* Use naming conventions for consistency.
* Add recursion guards.
* Allow framework-based trigger bypass.
* Start small: implement on new triggers, then migrate old ones.
