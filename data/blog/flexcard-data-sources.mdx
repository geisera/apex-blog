Salesforce OmniStudio FlexCards can retrieve and display data from various sources. These include:

2. **Integration Procedures**: Execute multiple actions in a single server call, allowing data retrieval from both internal and external sources. 

3. **SOQL Query**: Utilize Salesforce Object Query Language to search an organization's data for specific information. 

4. **SOSL Search**: Employ Salesforce Object Search Language to perform text-based searches across multiple objects. 

5. **REST Web Services**: Integrate with external REST APIs to fetch or post data. 

6. **Apex Remote**: Invoke Apex classes and methods to retrieve data. 

7. **Apex REST**: Use Apex REST endpoints to obtain data. 

8. **Custom JSON**: Embed static JSON data directly into the FlexCard, useful for testing or when external data sources are unavailable. 

9. **Streaming API**: Subscribe to real-time data updates from Salesforce. 

10. **SDK**: Leverage methods from Software Development Kits to retrieve data.
