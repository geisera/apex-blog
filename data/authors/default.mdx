Hi. I'm Tony, a seasoned Salesforce professional with a knack for turning complex business needs into smart, user-friendly solutions. I have extensive experience in Salesforce Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and OmniStudio, I'm known for building scalable applications that make workflows simpler and more efficient. I'm passionate about problem-solving and always staying ahead of the curve with the latest Salesforce technologies, I take pride in delivering solutions that not only meet today’s needs but are ready for tomorrow’s challenges.

Learning Salesforce was challenging because it’s more than just a single platform — it’s an entire ecosystem with its own unique language, tools, and constantly evolving features. Mastering concepts like Salesforce Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and OmniStudio requires not just technical know-how but also an understanding of how businesses operate. The learning curve can be steep, especially when navigating complex development frameworks, customization options, and the ever-expanding Salesforce release cycle. 

This experience inspired me to create **ForceDevNotes**, a platform dedicated to helping others overcome the same hurdles I faced. I realized that while official documentation is useful, real-world examples, clear explanations, and practical tips are often what make the difference. ForceDevNotes serves as a place where developers can find concise, actionable guidance on everything from coding best practices to solving tricky Salesforce problems. By sharing my knowledge, I aim to make the learning process faster and less frustrating for others following a similar path.

I am a United States Marine Corps veteran. A husband, and a father of two sons.

I am currently a Salesforce Certified Platform Developer I, Administrator, OmniStudio Consultant, and CPQ Specialist. He currently works as a consultant at Yudrio, Inc.

I makes great pancakes.
