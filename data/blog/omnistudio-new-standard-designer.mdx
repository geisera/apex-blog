**What’s New in the Standard OmniStudio Designer**

Salesforce’s new OmniStudio Designer (often called the “standard designer”) replaces the older Manage Package Designer with a modern, Flow-like interface. You’ll find faster performance, fewer clicks, and consistent tools across OmniScript, FlexCards, Data Mappers, and Integration Procedures. Here’s what to expect—and how to prepare your org.

---

## 1. Core Improvements

* **Modern UI & UX**

  * Left‐side element palette, right‐side properties, top‐bar actions—just like Flow Designer.
  * Drag-and-drop is noticeably snappier; tabs activate/deactivate instantly.
* **List Views**

  * OmniScript, FlexCard, Data Mapper, and Integration Procedure list views mimic Salesforce object lists.
  * Built-in search and standard list actions speed navigation.
* **Design Assistant**

  * Contextual warnings and tips appear in a side panel, guiding best practices.
* **Faster Preview & Activation**

  * Preview JSON and debug logs load quickly.
  * Activating new versions often takes seconds—not minutes.

## 2. Feature Comparisons

### 2.1 OmniScript Builder

* **Old vs. New List View**

  * Clone and trim fields (Name, Type, Subtype, Description, Last Modified) for clarity.
  * New view supports inline search; old view does not.
* **Element Activation**

  * Old: toggle “Disabled” in properties.
  * New: use the list-view toggle icon to gray-out elements.
* **Properties Access**

  * Old: place element → switch to Properties tab.
  * New: drop element → edit inline without tab switching.
* **Global Setup**

  * Old: buried under a Setup tab.
  * New: click the gear icon for script-level settings.
* **Canvas Resizing**

  * New: collapse side panels to maximize workspace.
  * Old: panels have limited collapse.

### 2.2 FlexCard Builder

* Mirror the OmniScript layout: elements left, properties right, actions top.
* Design Assistant and faster preview/debug mirror OmniScript.
* Data JSON and Action Debugger panes include search and highlighting.

### 2.3 Data Mapper Designer

* **Extract Tab**

  * Old “Extract Step” → New “Extract Object” with clearer naming.
  * “Extract Object Path” moved to the top for visibility.
* **Filter Section**

  * Field, operator, and value labels remain; the UI is tidier.
* **Mapping Tab**

  * Old “Output” → New “Mapping.”
  * Quick-match lives under Mapping; add new mappings via a popup window, reducing accidental edits.
* **Lock & Read-Only Modes**

  * Collapse sections to read-only; edit via pencil icon.
  * Buttons let you reorder filters or mappings without drag-and-drop only.

### 2.4 Integration Procedure Designer

* **Hybrid Layout**

  * Collapsible containers (like Data Mapper) + element palette (like OmniScript/FlexCard).
* **Procedure Properties**

  * Global settings moved from inline to a dedicated Properties panel.
* **Add Elements**

  * Click “Add” to search & insert elements (HTTP, DataRaptor, etc.)—no need to drag from the palette.
* **Collapsible Summaries**

  * Containers show a summary bar; expand for details.
* **Tabbed Configuration**

  * Input, output, and failure response each get a separate tab—keeps the page concise.
* **Enhanced Debugging**

  * Preview shows per-element status, elapsed time, inputs, and outputs for faster troubleshooting.

## 3. Known Limitations

1. **DataPack Import/Export**

   * Not supported in standard designer; use Salesforce CLI or toggle back to Manage Package Designer.
2. **Compatibility**

   * Components edited in standard designer won’t open in Manage Package Designer. Always create new versions when you switch.
3. **No “Deploy Standard LWC” Button**

   * FlexCard and OmniScript LWC activation must be handled manually; test thoroughly if you embed on Experience Cloud.
4. **Open Issues**

   * At launch, \~12 known issues affected UI and performance. Check Salesforce’s Known Issues page for “OmniStudio Standard Designer” to decide if you need to disable it until patches arrive.

## 4. Migration & Best Practices

1. **Enable Standard Designer by Default**

   * New orgs default to standard designer; Manage Package Designer toggle will disappear by Summer 2026.
2. **Phased Rollout**

   * **Sandbox Testing:**

     * Disable manage-package, create new versions of every OmniStudio component, activate & test.
   * **Backup Versions:**

     * If you must switch back, always clone your most recent active version first.
3. **Manage Package Toggle**

   * Temporarily re-enable Manage Package Designer via **OmniStudio ▶ Settings** to import/export DataPacks.
4. **Regression Checklist**

   * Validate OmniScripts, FlexCards, Data Mappers, Integration Procedures in both interfaces.
   * Confirm LWC activation processes.
   * Log any blockers and check Known Issues or open a support case.

## 5. Recap

The new standard OmniStudio Designer offers:

* A unified, Flow-style interface across all components
* Faster drag-and-drop, previews, and activations
* Inline editing and design assistance
* Improved list views and search

Before you flip the switch in production, clone your list views for clarity, test every component in a sandbox, and keep backups of your active versions. By summer 2026, the standard designer becomes the only game in town—so start adapting today!
