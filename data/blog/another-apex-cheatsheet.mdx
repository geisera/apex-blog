### Apex Technical Interview Prep Summary

---

#### Variables & Data Types

* Apex uses strong typing. Declare variables with explicit data types.
* Common types:

  * `Integer`, `Decimal`, `Double`: for numerical operations
  * `String`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Datetime`, `Time`, `Id`: native types for platform-specific operations
* Always initialize if possible. Constants use `final` keyword.

#### Collections
```apex
* List<T>: ordered collection, allows duplicates
* Set<T>: unordered, no duplicates
* Map\<K,V>: key-value structure
* Use `for-each` loops, collection methods (`add`, `remove`, `containsKey`, etc.)
* Always bulkify logic using collections for governor limit safety
```
#### sObjects

* All Salesforce records are `sObject`-based (e.g., `Account`, `Contact`)
* Cast dynamically using `(Account)sObject`
* Dynamic access with `.get(fieldName)`, `.put(fieldName, value)`
* Use `List<sObject>` for cross-object operations or dynamic queries

#### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

* `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `upsert` to manipulate records
* Use collections to handle batches
* Wrap operations in try/catch for error handling
* DML inside loops = anti-pattern; extract SOQL/DML outside of iterations

#### Enums

* Use `enum` to define finite sets of values
* Common with state logic (e.g., workflow steps)
* Pair with `switch` for clear logic branching

#### Operators & Control Flow

* Standard operators: arithmetic (`+`, `-`), comparison (`==`, `!=`), logical (`&&`, `||`), ternary (`?:`)
* **If/else**: conditional logic
* **Switch**: cleaner branching (works with enums and strings)
* **Loops**:

  * `for`: classic counter-controlled
  * `for-each`: iterate collections
  * `while` and `do-while`: conditional repetition

#### Triggers

* Execute logic before/after record DML
* Syntax: `trigger Name on Object (events)`
* Use context variables:

  * `Trigger.new`, `Trigger.old`
  * `Trigger.isBefore`, `Trigger.isAfter`, `Trigger.isInsert`, etc.
* Best practices:

  * Always bulkify
  * Move logic to handler classes
  * Avoid recursive triggers

#### SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)

* Used to query records
* Syntax: `SELECT fields FROM Object WHERE conditions`
* Filtering: `=`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `AND`, `OR`
* Aggregates: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* Relationships:

  * Parent: `SELECT Account.Name FROM Contact`
  * Child: `SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account`
* Always use `LIMIT` and bind variables using `:variable`

#### Dynamic SOQL

* Build queries at runtime
* Use `Database.query(String)`
* Escape inputs with `String.escapeSingleQuotes()`
* Supports flexible searches, admin tools, and UI-driven filters

#### SOSL (Search)

* Keyword-based, cross-object searching
* Syntax: `FIND 'text' RETURNING Object(Field, Field)`
* Result is a list of lists: one list per object type
* Ideal for global search, type-ahead inputs

#### Apex Classes

* Building blocks of Apex
* Can contain:

  * Properties (`{ get; set; }`)
  * Methods (void/return types)
  * Static methods/blocks
  * Constructors (same name as class)
  * Inner classes
* Use `this` to reference current instance
* `final` fields are immutable after assignment

#### Object-Oriented Features

* **Inheritance**: `class Sub extends Super`
* **Interfaces**: contract for method signatures; implemented with `implements`
* **Abstract Classes**: can't be instantiated; define common structure with abstract methods
* **Virtual**: allow overriding without requiring it
* Use `override` for method specialization
* Promote code reuse, testability, and maintainability

#### Serialization & Wrappers

* Use JSON methods to serialize/deserialize Apex objects:

  * `JSON.deserialize(json, Class.class)`
* Wrappers used in UI for checkboxes, selection, etc.

  ```apex
  public class MyWrapper {
      public Account acc;
      public Boolean selected;
  }
  ```

### Interview Tips

* Focus on **bulkification**, **governor limits**, and **clean architecture**
* Practice writing SOQL and triggers by hand
* Know when to use interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance
* Be able to explain how youâ€™d write a reusable, testable trigger framework
* Be clear on the difference between SOQL, SOSL, and Dynamic SOQL
* Know how to use `@testSetup`, `System.assertEquals()`, and test classes

Stay sharp. Think bulk, code clean, and always be testable.
