## OmniStudio DataRaptor Has a New Name

### It's Official:

Salesforce renamed DataRaptor to OmniStudio Data Mapper. You'll see the updated name in the feature name and labels in the OmniStudio designers, documentation, and Trailhead modules. 

Salesforce made these changes so that your implementations will continue to work. The new name will appear in OmniStudio Spring '24 release and later.

This change applies to all Salesforce editions with OmniStudio licenses.
