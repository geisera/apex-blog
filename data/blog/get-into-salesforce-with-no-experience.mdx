## How to Get a Salesforce Job With No Experience

Salesforce is used by over 150,000 companies. That means there are a lot of job opportunities. In the U.S. alone, more than 33,000 Salesforce jobs are open right now.

Globally, experts expect 9.3 million new Salesforce jobs by 2026. Even entry-level jobs pay well. Admins often start at $$70,000 per year, and developers closer to $78,000.

The market tightened in 2024. More people learned Salesforce, but job postings dropped 37%. In 2025, things are improving again but standing out is more important than ever.

## Earn Salesforce Certifications

Certifications are one of the best ways to break in. They show you're serious and have verified skills. Most job seekers already have one 76%, in fact.

Start with the Salesforce Administrator certification. If you're brand new, try the entry-level Salesforce Associate cert. You can learn everything for free using Trailhead, Salesforce’s official training platform.

Trailhead lets you complete interactive modules and earn badges. It’s practical, beginner-friendly, and widely respected. Certifications also boost your confidence and your resume.

## Optimize Your Resume

When applying for your first Salesforce job, tailor your resume to highlight relevant skills even if you haven’t held a formal Salesforce role yet. 

Add a “Salesforce Projects” section to showcase what you’ve built through Trailhead, volunteering, or personal projects. List your certifications clearly, include hands-on tools like Flows or Reports, and use action verbs like “configured,” “automated,” or “built” to describe your work. 

Keep it focused, clean, and aligned with the job description.

## Up Your LinkedIn Game

Your LinkedIn profile is often your first impression. Make it count. Use a clear headshot, write a short headline that includes "Salesforce," and add a summary that highlights your certifications and goals.

List your Salesforce badges, certs, and projects under Experience or Featured sections. Add keywords like “Salesforce Administrator,” “Trailhead,” and “CRM” so recruiters can find you.

Follow Salesforce influencers, comment on relevant posts, and share updates about your own learning. When you earn a cert or complete a project, post about it. Showing progress builds credibility and keeps you visible to your network.

---

## Network in the Salesforce Community

Connections help you get hired. The Salesforce community is famously welcoming to newcomers.

Join local user groups, attend “Dreamin’” events, or participate in online forums like the Trailblazer Community. Follow professionals on LinkedIn and comment on their posts. Share your own progress, like when you earn a badge or certification.

You might find a mentor or hear about a junior role. Many first jobs happen through referrals. Networking makes a big difference.

---

## Get Experience Through Internships or Volunteering

Experience doesn’t have to come from a paid job. Internships and apprenticeships are great ways to learn. Some companies offer them specifically for Salesforce newcomers.

You can also volunteer. Many nonprofits use Salesforce but don’t have a full-time admin. Help them with reports, automations, or data cleanup. Even a small project counts.

List that experience on your resume. For example: “Built a donation tracking app for a nonprofit.” It gives you real stories to tell in interviews and proves you can do the work.

---

## Try Freelance or Personal Projects

Freelance projects give you hands-on practice. Offer to help a local business, club, or friend set up Salesforce. Use a free Developer Edition org to create your own apps or automations.

Even unpaid or self-initiated work builds your skills. Document what you’ve built like a lead tracking system or email automation. Add it to your portfolio.

Mention freelance projects in interviews. They show initiative and problem-solving. These small wins add up fast.

---

## Apply and Stay Persistent

Once you have a certification, some experience, and network connections, start applying. Tailor your resume to highlight Trailhead badges, projects, and certs.

Apply for roles like Junior Salesforce Admin or Analyst even if they say “1–2 years experience.” Use your cover letter and interview to talk about what you’ve built and learned.

Rejection is normal. Keep improving your skills and applying. The job market is growing, and new roles open up all the time. Stay consistent, and you’ll break in.
