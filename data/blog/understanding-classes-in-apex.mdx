**Classes** are essentially blueprints for creating [**objects**](/blog/understanding-objects-in-apex). They encapsulate data and methods (functions) to perform operations on that data. Classes in Apex are similar to classes in other object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#.

## Key concepts related to classes in Salesforce Apex

### **Syntax**

A class in Apex is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and optional access modifiers (`public`, `private`, or `global`). Here's a basic syntax:

```apex
public class MyClass {
    // Class members (variables and methods) go here
}
```

### **Access Modifiers**

- `public`: Accessible from any Apex code within the same application.
- `private`: Accessible only within the same class.
- `global`: Accessible from any Apex code in the Salesforce organization.

### **Class Members**

- **Variables**: Variables declared within a class represent the state or data of the class. They can have different access modifiers.
- **Methods (Functions)**: Methods define the behavior of the class. They can be `void` (not returning any value) or returning a specific data type.

### **Constructors**

Constructors are special methods invoked when an object of a class is created. They initialize the object's state. In Apex, constructors have the same name as the class and no return type. They are typically used to initialize member variables.

### **Instantiation**

Once a class is defined, you can create instances (objects) of that class using the `new` keyword. For example:

```apex
MyClass obj = new MyClass();
```

### **Example**

Here's a simple example illustrating a class in Apex:

```apex
public class Car {
    // Class variables
    public String make;
    public Integer year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String make, Integer year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display car information
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.debug('Make: ' + make);
        System.debug('Year: ' + year);
    }
}
```

### **Using Classes**

Once a class is defined, you can use its methods and access its variables within your Apex code. For example:

```apex
Car myCar = new Car('Toyota', 2020);
myCar.displayInfo();
```

Classes are fundamental building blocks of custom business logic in the Salesforce platform. They enable developers to create modular, reusable code that enhances the functionality of Salesforce applications.
