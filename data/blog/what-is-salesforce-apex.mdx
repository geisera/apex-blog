summary: Understanding the backend, business logic engine of Salesforce!

**Salesforce Apex** is the backend, business logic engine of Salesforce.

It is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language designed for developing applications and functionalities within the **Salesforce platform**.

Similar to Java, tt allows developers to write custom business logic that runs on Salesforce servers.

### **Key Features of Apex**
1. **Object-Oriented**: Apex uses classes, objects, and inheritance, similar to Java or C#.
2. **Strongly Typed**: Variables and method return types are explicitly defined.
3. **Cloud-Based**: Apex code runs on Salesforceâ€™s multi-tenant, on-demand cloud infrastructure.
4. **Tightly Integrated with Salesforce**: Apex provides built-in support for Salesforce objects (like Account, Contact, Lead, etc.) and platform events.
5. **Database Integration**: Developers can execute SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements directly in Apex.
6. **Governor Limits**: Salesforce imposes limits (like CPU time, heap size, and SOQL query limits) to ensure fair use of resources in the multi-tenant environment.
7. **Bulk Processing**: Apex supports bulk data processing with batch jobs, making it ideal for working with large datasets.

### **When to Use Apex**
1. **Custom Business Logic**: Create triggers and workflows to automate business processes.
2. **Custom APIs**: Expose Salesforce functionality to external applications using REST/SOAP web services.
3. **Batch Processing**: Handle large data sets efficiently using batch jobs or scheduled jobs.
4. **Custom Controllers for Visualforce or Lightning Components**: Build dynamic, interactive user interfaces for Salesforce users.

### **Examples of Apex Usage**
1. **Triggers**: Automatically update a related record when a change occurs.
2. **Batch Jobs**: Process thousands of records asynchronously, ideal for large data updates.
3. **Custom Web Services**: Build endpoints for external apps to interact with Salesforce.
4. **Custom Validations**: Write custom logic to validate inputs beyond standard validation rules.

### **Simple Apex Trigger Example**
```apex
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
    for(Account acc : Trigger.new) {
        if(acc.Industry == 'Technology') {
            acc.Description = 'This is a tech company.';
        }
    }
}
```
This trigger updates the `Description` field for Accounts that are part of the **Technology** industry.
