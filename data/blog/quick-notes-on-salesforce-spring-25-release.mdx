The Salesforce Spring '25 release is set to introduce several enhancements designed to improve user experience, security, and system performance. To help you prepare effectively, here's a concise overview of the most impactful updates and recommended preparation steps:

## **Key Updates and Enhancements:**

### **Change Einstein Activity Capture Permissions for Sales Engagement Basic Users:**
   - **Impact:** Users assigned the Sales Engagement Basic User permission set will lose access to Einstein Activity Capture unless reassigned the Standard Einstein Activity Capture permission set.
   - **Preparation:** Identify affected users and update their permission sets accordingly. 

### **Enable ICU Locale Formats:**
   - **Impact:** Salesforce is transitioning from Oracle’s Java Development Kit (JDK) to ICU Locale Formats, affecting date, time, and number formatting.
   - **Preparation:** Test the new formats in a sandbox environment to identify potential impacts on your processes. 

### **Enable LWC Stacked Modals:**
   - **Impact:** To enhance page load performance, Salesforce is converting more of the user interface from legacy Aura components to Lightning Web Components (LWC).
   - **Preparation:** Review and test any custom quick actions built with Aura or LWC to ensure compatibility. 

### **Enforce Permission Requirements Defined on Built-In Apex Classes Used as Inputs:**
   - **Impact:** When using an Apex action in a Flow, users will need to have access to the underlying records being affected if the Apex action is defined to enforce user permissions.
   - **Preparation:** Review your Flows and Apex actions to ensure appropriate user permissions are in place. 

### **Enforce Rollbacks for Apex Action Exceptions in REST API:**
   - **Impact:** Apex actions run via the REST API will now roll back if they encounter exceptions, ensuring consistent database changes.
   - **Preparation:** Test your integrations to confirm they handle exceptions appropriately under the new rollback behavior. 

**Preparation Timeline:**

- **December 19, 2024:** Sign up for a pre-release Developer Edition environment to explore Spring '25 features. 

- **December 31, 2024:** Review the official Salesforce Release Notes for detailed information on all updates. 

- **January 2, 2025 (by 5 p.m. PT):** Refresh your sandbox to test new features against your customizations. 

- **January 3, 2025:** Sandbox Preview begins; utilize this period for thorough testing. 

- **January 16, 2025:** Salesforce will share features in the Admin Evangelist’s Release Blog, highlighting top features to be release-ready. 

**General Recommendations:**

- **Plan Ahead:** Schedule updates during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.

### Here's hoping you all have a wonderful 2025!
