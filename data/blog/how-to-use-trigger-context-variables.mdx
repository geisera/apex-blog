Trigger context variables in Salesforce are special system-provided variables that allow you to access and manipulate data within an Apex Trigger.
They provide crucial information about the current operation, such as whether the trigger is running before or after a database operation, which records are involved, and details about the context in which the trigger is executing.

### Key Trigger Context Variables

These are the primary context variables available in Apex Triggers:

1. **`Trigger.new`**:

   - A list of the new versions of the records that are currently being processed by the trigger.
   - Available in `insert` and `update` triggers.
   - It’s a `List<SObject>` of the records that are about to be inserted or updated.
   - Example: `Trigger.new` for an `Account` object will be `List<Account>`.

2. **`Trigger.old`**:

   - A list of the old versions of the records before they were modified.
   - Available in `update` and `delete` triggers.
   - Useful for comparing the current and previous values.
   - Example: `Trigger.old` for an `Account` object will be `List<Account>`.

3. **`Trigger.newMap`**:

   - A map of the new versions of the records, keyed by their IDs.
   - Available in `insert` and `update` triggers.
   - Provides efficient access to records by their IDs.
   - Example: `Trigger.newMap` for an `Account` object will be `Map<Id, Account>`.

4. **`Trigger.oldMap`**:

   - A map of the old versions of the records, keyed by their IDs.
   - Available in `update` and `delete` triggers.
   - Useful for quick lookup of the old state of records before changes.
   - Example: `Trigger.oldMap` for an `Account` object will be `Map<Id, Account>`.

5. **`Trigger.isInsert`**:

   - Boolean variable indicating if the trigger was fired due to an `insert` operation.

6. **`Trigger.isUpdate`**:

   - Boolean variable indicating if the trigger was fired due to an `update` operation.

7. **`Trigger.isDelete`**:

   - Boolean variable indicating if the trigger was fired due to a `delete` operation.

8. **`Trigger.isBefore`**:

   - Boolean variable indicating if the trigger was fired before any records were saved to the database.

9. **`Trigger.isAfter`**:

   - Boolean variable indicating if the trigger was fired after all records were saved to the database.

10. **`Trigger.isUndelete`**:

    - Boolean variable indicating if the trigger was fired after a record was undeleted from the Recycle Bin.

11. **`Trigger.size`**:
    - The total number of records in `Trigger.new` or `Trigger.old` lists.
    - Useful for knowing how many records are being processed in bulk operations.

### How to Use Trigger Context Variables

Let’s look at a few practical examples to understand how these context variables are used within an Apex Trigger.

#### Example 1: Using `Trigger.new` and `Trigger.old`

This trigger ensures that whenever an `Account` is updated, its `Industry` field must be different from the previous value.

```apex
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before update) {
    for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
        Account oldAcc = Trigger.oldMap.get(acc.Id);
        if (acc.Industry != oldAcc.Industry) {
            // Custom logic when Industry changes
            acc.Description = 'Industry was changed';
        }
    }
}
```

- `Trigger.new` provides the new versions of the records.
- `Trigger.oldMap` allows quick access to the old versions by their IDs for comparison.

#### Example 2: Using `Trigger.newMap` and `Trigger.isBefore`

This trigger sets a default `Status` to "New" for all `Account` records before they are inserted, if the `Status` is not already set.

```apex
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {
    if (Trigger.isBefore && Trigger.isInsert) {
        for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
            if (acc.Status__c == null) {
                acc.Status__c = 'New';
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- `Trigger.new` is used to iterate over the records being inserted.
- `Trigger.isBefore` and `Trigger.isInsert` ensure the logic runs only before an insert operation.

#### Example 3: Using `Trigger.isAfter` and `Trigger.isInsert`

This trigger creates a default contact for each new `Account` after it is inserted.

```apex
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (after insert) {
    if (Trigger.isAfter && Trigger.isInsert) {
        List<Contact> contacts = new List<Contact>();
        for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
            Contact con = new Contact(
                LastName = 'Default',
                AccountId = acc.Id
            );
            contacts.add(con);
        }
        insert contacts;
    }
}
```

- `Trigger.isAfter` and `Trigger.isInsert` ensure the logic runs only after new records are inserted.
- `Trigger.new` is used to access the newly inserted records, and their IDs are now available for creating related contacts.

#### Example 4: Using `Trigger.isDelete`

This trigger logs a message whenever an `Account` is deleted.

```apex
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before delete) {
    if (Trigger.isDelete) {
        for (Account acc : Trigger.old) {
            System.debug('Account being deleted: ' + acc.Name);
        }
    }
}
```

- `Trigger.isDelete` confirms the trigger runs during a delete operation.
- `Trigger.old` contains the records being deleted, allowing you to log or process them before deletion.

### Summary of When to Use Each Variable

- **`Trigger.new`**: When you need to access or modify the new versions of records being inserted or updated.
- **`Trigger.old`**: When you need to compare with the old versions of records being updated or deleted.
- **`Trigger.newMap` and `Trigger.oldMap`**: For efficient lookups and operations based on record IDs.
- **`Trigger.isInsert`, `Trigger.isUpdate`, `Trigger.isDelete`, `Trigger.isUndelete`**: To determine the type of DML operation triggering the event.
- **`Trigger.isBefore` and `Trigger.isAfter`**: To distinguish between pre-save and post-save operations.
- **`Trigger.size`**: To know the number of records being processed in bulk operations.

By leveraging these context variables appropriately, you can write efficient, maintainable, and effective triggers to handle complex business logic and automate processes within Salesforce.
