### What areData Mappers core capabilities?
ETL For Salesforce : Data Mapper Mapping tool enable read, write and transform JSON and XML inputs. It also helped in perform intermediate data transformation without reading from or writing to Salesforce.
Declarative no code/ Low Code : Data Mapper is a declarative tool and no code is required to get data from Salesforce.
Substitute for Apex: Although apex classes can read write and transform data they can take longer to create and are harder to maintain then Data Mappers. Therefore, use Data Mapper as Vlocity best practice.
Handle custom data Formulas : Data Mapper Extract and Load can handle custom data formats. It can access external object and custom metadata as well as sObject.

### What are some Types of OmniStudio Data Mappers?
- Turbo Extract: Read data from a single Salesforce object type, with support for fields from related objects. Then select the fields to include. Formulas and complex field mappings aren’t supported.
- Extract: Read data from Salesforce objects and output JSON or XML with complex field mappings. Formulas are supported. We can data from one or more Objects.
- Transform: Perform intermediate data transformations without reading from or writing to Salesforce. Formulas are supported.
- Load: Update Salesforce data from JSON or XML input. Formulas are supported.

### Describe some OmniStudio Data Mappers best practices?
- Allocate space to Vlocity Metadata Platform Cache
- Allocate space to Vlocity Metadata to cache Data Mapper Metadata. Allocate space only to Org Cache. You can allocate 5 MB or what is needed in your context.
- Create targeted Data Mappers and limit the number of Objects to 3 where possible
- Create targeted Data Mappers that only extract or load the data needed for one operation. Try to keep the number of objects to 3 or
less
- Use Relationship Query to reduce the number of Extract Objects
- Use relationship notation (queries) whenever possible to pull data from other SObjects.
- Trim the data sent to and received from Data Mapper
- Send only the necessary input and return only the outputs you need.
- Reduce where possible Data Mapper Formula
- Data Mapper works in series, limit where possible the number of formulas for better performance
- Use Turbo Extract, more performant where  possible
- When you have 1 Object to extract and no formula, Use Turbo
- Use Data Mapper Data Cache (Session or Org)where possible
- Use caching to store frequently accessed, infrequently updated data
- Ensure that all filters and sorts have supporting indexes
- Ensure that all filtering and sorting (ORDER BY) operations are on indexed fields. The Id and Name fields are always indexed.
- Use OOTB functionality where possible before creating a custom Formula
- Before creating a new formula, check the solution with:
- OOTB formula Output Type OOTB config (Map Values)
- Server processing time must be under 5 sec.
- For synchronous Transaction, to avoid hitting Salesforce Governor Limits for Long Running Transaction, processing time must be under 5 sec.

### What are some of the top common mistakes of Data Mappers
- VlocityMetadata Platform Cache is not set
