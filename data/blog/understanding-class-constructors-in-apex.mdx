summary: An overview of Salesforce Apex class constructors.

In Apex, constructors are special methods within a [**class**](/blog/understanding-classes-in-apex) that are automatically invoked when an object of that class is created using the `new` keyword. Constructors initialize the newly created object, setting initial values to its member variables or performing other initialization tasks.

## Key points about class constructors in Salesforce Apex

### **Syntax**

- Constructors in Apex have the same name as the class they belong to.
- They don't have a return type, not even `void`.
- Constructors can be overloaded, meaning a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

### **Purpose**

- Constructors are primarily used to initialize the state of an object when it is created.
- They set initial values to member variables, perform validation, or execute any other necessary setup tasks.

### **Default Constructor**

- If a class doesn't explicitly define any constructors, Apex provides a default constructor with no parameters.
- The default constructor initializes member variables to their default values (null for reference types, 0 for numeric types, false for Boolean, etc.).

### **Overloading Constructors**

- Apex supports constructor overloading, allowing a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
- Overloaded constructors provide flexibility in object initialization by allowing different ways to create objects.

### **Calling Superclass Constructors**

- If a subclass extends a superclass, the subclass constructor can call the constructor of its superclass using the `super()` keyword.
- This is useful for initializing inherited members or performing common initialization tasks defined in the superclass.

### **Example**

Here's an example illustrating the use of constructors in Salesforce Apex:

```apex
public class MyClass {
    public String name;
    public Integer age;

    // Default constructor
    public MyClass() {
        name = 'John Doe';
        age = 30;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public MyClass(String newName, Integer newAge) {
        name = newName;
        age = newAge;
    }

    // Constructor calling superclass constructor
    public class MySubClass extends MyClass {
        public MySubClass() {
            super(); // Call superclass constructor
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `MyClass` has two constructors: a default constructor that initializes `name` and `age`, and a parameterized constructor that allows custom initialization.
- `MySubClass` extends `MyClass` and calls the superclass constructor using `super()`.

Constructors play a crucial role in initializing objects and ensuring that they are in a valid state when they are created. They provide flexibility and reusability in object initialization within Apex classes.
