## What is Omnistudio?

OmniStudio is a suite of digital engagement tools to help users create complex, industry-specific experiences. It is part of the Salesforce Industries product suite and aims to enhance the way businesses interact with their customers by streamlining processes and improving user experiences.

## Key Components:

1. [**OmniScripts**](intro-to-omniscripts) are interactive, guided user experiences that help users complete tasks or processes. They are highly customizable and can include various elements such as input fields, actions, and conditional logic to guide users step-by-step through complex workflows.

2. **FlexCards** display contextual information from Salesforce or external systems in a compact and interactive way. They are useful for presenting data in dashboards, community portals, and mobile apps, allowing users to view and update records easily.

3. **DataRaptors** are tools that allow the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data within Salesforce without the need for Apex code. They support various operations like reading data from Salesforce objects, transforming the data, and writing it back to Salesforce.

4. **Integration Procedures** are server-side processes that handle complex data manipulations and interaction with external systems.
