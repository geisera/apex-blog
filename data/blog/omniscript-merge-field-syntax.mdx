summary: How to access OmniScript data JSON through merge fields.
---

You can use **merge fields** in your OmniScripts to pull information from data stored in JSON format. Think of merge fields as placeholders that get replaced with the actual value from your data. 

For example, if your data says `"FirstName": "John"`, the merge field `%FirstName%` will show "John".

To let OmniScript know you're using a merge field, you need to follow a special rule for writing it. You put the JSON path (the "address" of the data) inside percent signs (`%`). This tells OmniScript, "Hey, look here for the data!"

So, if you want an OmniScript element to show someone's first name, you would write `%FirstName%`. OmniScript will then grab "John" from the JSON data and display it.
